# Steganography---Image-and-text-encoding-and-decoding
This project consists of python scripts written by me which can hide image in image and text in image and can decode it at the receiver end giving back the same image and decodes the text from image . It is mainly used when we want to hide data or image in a image and recover it at the receiving end . The project is running successfully .
